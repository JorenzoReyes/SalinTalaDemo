just thinking about how many trainees did not get to debut just because they did not fit the image of the group the company wants to think na ininstill sa kanila yung thot na makakadebut ka lang pag nagwork hard ka (meritocracy) wll it's tru na kailangan nilang kumayod,"I'm just thinking about how many trainees didn't get to debut just because they didn't fit the image of the group that the company wants to think they instilled in them, that you can only debut if you work hard (meritocracy). Well, it's true that they need to work hard"
"at magwork hard sa early-mid stages ng trainee life para magimprove at makapasa sa monthly evaluation, pero sa later stage or phase ng trainee journey yung mismong before debut, kahit anong pagpapractice mo ng todo kung di ka bagay sa group na gusto nilang idebut+","and work hard in the early-mid stages of their trainee life to improve and pass the monthly evaluations, but in the later stage or phase of the trainee journey, right before debut, no matter how much you practice, if you don't fit the group they want to debut"
"parang masasayang lang lahat. diba may mga issue din about sa mga popular or known trainees na kesyo bakit umalis sila sa certain entertainment, may naviolate ba sila? ganon, di ba natin naisip na what if inalis lang sila kasi ayaw ng company sa appeal or image nila",it feels like it'll all be for nothing. There are also issues about the popular or well-known trainees and why they left a certain entertainment company. Did they violate something? didn't we ever think that what if they were just removed because the company didn't like their appeal or image?
andaming circumstances na madaming popular trainees ang umalis sa isang company then later mababalitaan na magdedebut na ng group yung company na yon. e.g yung time na andaming popular sm trainees na umalis sa SM noon den nabalitaan nalang natin idedebut na ang aespa. DIBA,"There are so many instances where many popular trainees leave a company, and then later we hear that the company is debuting a group. For example, when so many popular SM trainees left SM before Aespa was announced to debut. RIGHT?"
di ko sinasabi na yun dahilan pero WHAT IF,"I'm not saying that's the reason, but WHAT IF?"
gusto ko talaga maging insider hahahah gusto ko malaman yung thought process ng mga teachers ng trainees at producers sa pagpili ng trainees na idedebut. napanood ko yung documentary ng stayc like legit sinasabi sa kanila na di sila nagwork hard masyado ganon,"I really want to be an insider hahaha, I want to know the thought process of the trainee teachers and producers when choosing the trainees to debut. I watched the STAYC documentary, and they literally told them that they weren't working hard enough, things like that."
na di sila makakadebut kung ganyan ang performance nila. pero nung last evaluation na may tinanggal na isa at mahahalata mo talaga na di sya bagay sa image ng stayc PLS or psychology eme lang to na nasanay lang akong tignan ang stayc.,"That they wouldn't be able to debut if their performance remained like that. But during the last evaluation, they eliminated someone, and you can really tell that she didn't fit the image of STAYC. PLS, or is this just something psychological inside me, and I've just gotten used to seeing STAYC a certain way?"
"Akala mo di masakit sakit sakin yung pinag sasabi mo saken ? Na patay Gutom ako ? Bakit ? Di ba yun sa- masakit ? Ikaw nga inuulam mo kalapati eh .

so nung pinanganak si Krist0.. dun nagkasira sira ang samahan ng mgaRomano? Tama ba ko? Parang kasi sa Egypt may kinalaman din sila.

That's why Egypt became rich before.

"Lalong lumakas ang iyak ni Sebby at mukhang nahihirapan na itong huminga kaya naman umupo na si Justin upang patahanin ang anak. ""Baby... Sebby? Stop crying na, Taytay is fine oh. I'm not crying na. Shhh na baby ko..."" But the kid is still crying which made Justin worried.","Sebby cried even harder and looked like he was having a hard time breathing so Justin sat down to calm his son. ""Baby... Sebby? Stop crying now, Taytay is fine oh. I'm not crying anymore. Shhh now my baby..."" But the kid is still crying which made Justin worried."
"""Umalis ka na, Ken. Parang awa mo na. Sebby will not stop crying while you're here."" Ken couldn't accept it. Sa isip niya ay kaya pa niyang patahanin ang anak kaya muli siyang lumapit pero mas lalong umiyak ang bata. ""Ken, ano ba?! I said, leave! Umalis ka na! Iwan mo na kami!""","""Leave now, Ken. For pity's sake. Sebby will not stop crying while you're here."" Ken couldn't accept it. In his mind, he can still calm his son so he approached again but the child cried even harder. ""Ken, what is it?! I said, leave! Leave now! Leave us!"""
"""N-No... Sebby—"" ""He has an asthma, okay?! Kapag inatake siya dahil sa pagmamatigas mo, I swear to God. I will never forgive you, Ken."" Sandaling natigilan si Ken bago napatingin sa anak na mukhang nahihirapan nang huminga. Ken grabbed his hair out of frustration. ""Damn it!""","""N-No... Sebby —"" ""He has an asthma, okay?! If he has an attack because of your stubbornness, I swear to God. I will never forgive you, Ken."" Ken paused for a moment before looking at his son who looked like he was having a hard time breathing. Ken grabbed his hair out of frustration. ""Damn it!"""
Kahit labag sa loob ay tumayo si Ken at dire-diretsong lumabas ng bahay. He doesn't want Sebby to suffer longer just because he wanted to fix things right away. Nang makarating sa labas ay sinuntok niya ang isang puno malapit sa sasakyan na kinaroroonan ni Josh.,"Even against his will, Ken stood up and went straight out of the house. He doesn't want Sebby to suffer longer just because he wanted to fix things right away. When he got outside, he punched a tree near the car where Josh was."
"""FUCK THIS LIFE, FUCK EVERYTHING!"" Kulang ang salitang galit sa nararamdaman ni Ken ngayon. Galit sa sarili, galit sa boss niya, at galit sa taong gumulo sa mga plano niya. Matapos ang ilang suntok ay kusang tumigil si Ken sa labis na panghihina. Napaupo siya habang umiiyak.","""FUCK THIS LIFE, FUCK EVERYTHING!"" The word anger is not enough to describe what Ken feels now. Angry at himself, angry at his boss, and angry at the person who messed up his plans. After a few punches, Ken stopped spontaneously due to extreme weakness. He sat down while crying."
"""I'm sorry, bun. I'm sorry, baby."" Ken whispered under his breath. He is crying miserably for who-knows-how-long. Ang tanging alam lang ni Ken ay nasasaktan siya higit pa sa sakit na naramdaman niya noong nakipaghiwalay siya kay Justin. ""Ken! Anong nangyari sa'yo?"" It was Josh.","""I'm sorry, bun. I'm sorry, baby."" Ken whispered under his breath. He is crying miserably for who-knows-how-long. All Ken knows is that he is hurting more than the pain he felt when he broke up with Justin. ""Ken! What happened to you?"" It was Josh."
"Ken cracked a bitter laugh, ""Olats, dre. Napaiyak ko lang mag-ama ko, tangina. Sakit pala 'no? Marinig sa mismong anak mo na hate ka niya? Gago, dre. Para akong sinagasaan ng sampung truck, ang sikip ng dibdib ko."" Josh knew immediately that the talk didn't end well.","Ken cracked a bitter laugh, ""It was a failure, dre. I just made my family cry, damn it. It hurts, doesn't it? To hear your own child say he hates you? Man, dre. I feel like I was run over by ten trucks, my chest is so tight."" Josh knew immediately that the talk didn't end well."
"Lumapit si Josh at tinabihan ang kaibigang nakaupo sa gilid ng kalsada. ""Anong plano mo?"" Umiling si Ken nang paulit-ulit, ""Ewan. Gusto ko lang naman mabuhay nang payapa at tahimik kasama ng pamilya ko. Ganoon ba talaga iyon kahirap? Mabigat ba ang hiling ko?""","Josh approached and sat beside his friend who was sitting on the side of the road. ""What's your plan?"" Ken shook his head repeatedly, ""I don't know. I just want to live peacefully and quietly with my family. Is that really so hard? Is my request too heavy?"""
"Josh tapped his friend's back. He doesn't know what to say but he knows what his friend needs. ""Tara sa loob ng sasakyan. Magpahinga ka muna."" After few more minutes, Ken wiped his tears away. ""Tara sa condo ko."" And with that, they drove their way to Ken's place.","Josh tapped his friend's back. He doesn't know what to say but he knows what his friend needs. ""Let's go inside the car. Rest for a while."" After a few more minutes, Ken wiped his tears away. ""Let's go to my condo."" And with that, they drove their way to Ken's place."
"Upon arrival, unang hinanap ni Ken ay ang spare phone niya. He dialed a number. ""Hello, Detective Grey? Long time no talk. I need you to do something for me."" Ken knew what he needs to do. Instead of crying at the corner, he knows he needed to start a long overdue fight.","Upon arrival, Ken first looked for his spare phone. He dialed a number. ""Hello, Detective Grey? Long time no talk. I need you to do something for me."" Ken knew what he needs to do. Instead of crying at the corner, he knows he needed to start a long overdue fight."
"-- Another four days had passed. Ken got busy fixing and preparing things for whatever he is planning to do. ""Yow, nandito na ang pogi. Saan tayo today?"" Bungad ni Josh nang makapasok siya sa condo ni Ken. The latter fixed the files he received today, ""Tara. Ako magdadrive.""","""- Another four days had passed. Ken got busy fixing and preparing things for whatever he is planning to do. ""Yow, the handsome one is here. Where are we going today?"" Josh greeted as he entered Ken's condo. The latter fixed the files he received today, ""Let's go. I'll drive."""
"Sa loob ng ilang araw ay kapansin-pansin ang pagiging seryoso ni Ken. Halos hindi ito mabiro ni Josh dahil parang anytime ay bubuga ito ng apoy. Tulad na lang ngayon. ""Hoy, nakakunot nanaman ang noo mo. Mukha ka na talagang gurang nyan."" ""Shut up, Santos. I'm driving.""","For a few days, Ken's seriousness was noticeable. Josh could hardly joke with him because it seemed like he would breathe fire anytime. Just like now. ""Hey, your forehead is frowning again. You really look old like that."" ""Shut up, Santos. I'm driving."""
"Oh di ba? Anong connect ng pagdadrive sa pagkunot ng noo? Napaismid na lang si Josh at tumingin sa labas ng bintana. Napansin niyang hindi pamilyar ang daan na tinatahak nila. ""Hindi mo ba talaga sasabihin kung saan ang punta natin? Baka itanan mo na ako ah, hindi ako ready.""","Oh, right? What's the connection between driving and frowning? Josh just grimaced and looked out the window. He noticed that the road they were taking was unfamiliar. ""You're not really going to tell me where we're going? You might elope with me, I'm not ready."""
"Sandaling sinamaan ng tingin ni Ken si Josh bago muling itinuon ang paningin sa daan. Josh giggled upon seeing his friend's reaction. ""Chill, init ng ulo eh."" Josh knew why Ken is acting this way. Ikaw ba naman ang itaboy ng anak mo, makakangiti ka pa ba?","Ken glared at Josh for a moment before focusing his attention back on the road. Josh giggled upon seeing his friend's reaction. ""Chill, hot-headed eh."" Josh knew why Ken is acting this way. If your child rejects you, will you still be able to smile?"
Josh wanted to clear the air even for a while but he thought that it's quite impossible given Ken's current situation. Matapos ang mahigit isang oras ay pumasok sila sa hindi familiar na subdivision. Tiningnan pa ni Josh ang paligid ngunit wala talaga siyang kilalang taga-roon.,"Josh wanted to clear the air even for a while but he thought that it's quite impossible given Ken's current situation. After more than an hour, they entered an unfamiliar subdivision. Josh even looked around but he really didn't know anyone from there."
"Magtatanong na sana siya nang huminto si Ken sa harap ng isang bahay. Dire-diretso itong bumaba ng sasakyan at tatlong beses nagdoorbell. Nang walang lumabas ay muling pinindot ni Ken ang doorbell. Sinaway na siya ni Josh. ""Hoy, dahan-dahan. Parang may galit sa doorbell ah.""","He was about to ask when Ken stopped in front of a house. He went straight out of the car and rang the doorbell three times. When no one came out, Ken pressed the doorbell again. Josh scolded him. ""Hey, take it easy. It's like you're angry at the doorbell eh."""
"Ken just rolled his eyes and continued pressing the doorbell. After few seconds, the door opened. ""Sino ba 'yan? Hindi ka ba makapaghintay?!"" Napasipol si Josh nang mapagtanto kung sino ang pinuntahan nila. It's Xander. Hindi naman pala sa doorbell galit, doon sa may-ari pala.","Ken just rolled his eyes and continued pressing the doorbell. After a few seconds, the door opened. ""Who is it? Can't you wait?!"" Josh whistled when he realized who they went to. It's Xander. So it wasn't the doorbell he was angry at, it was the owner."
"""What the fuck are you doing here?"" Kunot noong tanong ni Xander. Napangisi naman si Ken. ""Papapasukin mo ako o gusto mong mapahiya sa labas ng bahay mo?"" The tension between the two gave a little excitement to Josh. He wants to see what will happen to this sudden meet up.","""What the fuck are you doing here?"" Xander asked with a frown. Ken smirked. ""Will you let me in or do you want to be embarrassed outside your house?"" The tension between the two gave a little excitement to Josh. He wants to see what will happen to this sudden meet up."
"Wala nang nagawa si Xander kung hindi ang pagbuksan ng pinto sina Ken at Josh. Ayaw naman niyang gumawa ng eksena sa labas ng bahay. Nang makapasok sa loob ay agad ding nagsalita si Ken, ""Mmm, you're living in a pretty decent house. You're also a CPA, am I right?""","Xander had no choice but to open the door for Ken and Josh. He didn't want to make a scene outside the house. When they got inside, Ken immediately spoke, ""Mmm, you're living in a pretty decent house. You're also a CPA, am I right?"""
"Xander is confused with Ken's actions but he still managed to answer, ""Yeah. Ano bang kailangan mo?"" ""You're a CPA working in an auditing firm with a good reputation. Bet you're earning bigger than the minimum wage. Tama ba?"" Ken plastered a smile to Xander— a sarcastic one.","Xander is confused with Ken's actions but he still managed to answer, ""Yeah. What do you need?"" ""You're a CPA working in an auditing firm with a good reputation. Bet you're earning bigger than the minimum wage. Am I right?"" Ken plastered a smile to Xander— a sarcastic one."
"""I don't understand your point. Pwede bang umalis na lang ka—"" Natigilan si Xander sa biglaang pagtawa ni Ken. Naglakad ito papalapit sa kaniya at pagkatapos ay tumigil sa mismong harapan niya. ""Maayos naman ang sweldo mo, bakit kailangan mong huthutan ng pera ang kumpanya ko?""","""I don't understand your point. Can you just lea—"" Xander stopped when Ken suddenly laughed. He walked closer to him and then stopped right in front of him. ""Your salary is fine, why do you need to extort money from my company?"""
"Xander was taken aback by Ken's question. He immediately turned his head away. ""Anong pinagsasasabi mo? Wala akong alam sa ibinibintang mo."" Ken laugh sarcastically, ""Really, Xander? Wala kang alam sa mga litrato naming kumalat sa internet?"" Xander stepped back, ""Wala.""","Xander was taken aback by Ken's question. He immediately turned his head away. ""What are you talking about? I don't know anything about what you're accusing me of."" Ken laugh sarcastically, ""Really, Xander? You don't know anything about our pictures that are spreading on the internet?"" Xander stepped back, ""Nothing."""
"Ken let out a playful smirk. Lumayo siya nang kaunti at kinuha ang envelope na ipinadala sa kaniya kaninang umaga. ""You mean, hindi ikaw 'to? Eh sino siya? Kakambal mo?"" Inilapag ni Ken isa-isa ang mga litrato ni Xander na kuha habang nakasunod siya sa pamilya ni Ken.","Ken let out a playful smirk. He moved away a little and took the envelope that was sent to him this morning. ""You mean, this isn't you? Who is he then? Your twin?"" Ken placed the pictures of Xander one by one, pictures that were taken while he was following Ken's family."
"Nanlaki ang mga mata ni Xander nang makita ang mga pictures niya, ""S-Saan mo nakuha ang mga iyan?"" Nagkibit balikat naman si Ken, ""How does it feel, Xander? Ang makita mo ang mga litrato mong hawak ng ibang tao?"" Unti-unting nawala ang ngisi sa mukha ni Ken.","Xander's eyes widened when he saw his pictures, ""W-Where did you get those?"" Ken shrugged, ""How does it feel, Xander? To see your pictures being held by other people?"" The smile on Ken's face slowly disappeared."
"Akmang kukunin ni Xander ang mga pictures pero pinigilan siya ni Ken at itinulak palayo. ""Fuck, akin na 'yan! Wala kang karapatang—"" ""Wala akong karapatang kunin ang mga screenshots mula sa CCTV na nakakita sa katarantaduhang ginagawa mo sa pamilya ko?"" Pagtutuloy ni Ken.","Xander was about to take the pictures but Ken stopped him and pushed him away. ""Fuck, give that to me! You have no right—"" ""I have no right to take the screenshots from the CCTV that saw the nonsense you're doing to my family?"" Ken continued."
"Nagtiim ang bagang ni Ken sa tindi ng pagpipigil niya na huwag masuntok ang lalaking nasa harapan niya. ""I am doing what you did to us, Xander. Mas malala pa nga 'yung ginawa mo eh. Galit na galit ka na sa lagay na 'yan? Now, imagine how much I am raging inside right now.""","Ken clenched his jaw as he tried hard not to punch the man in front of him. ""I am doing what you did to us, Xander. What you did was even worse. You're so angry now, aren't you? Now, imagine how much I am raging inside right now."""
"Ken hired a detective to look upon the root of the issue. He wanted to make sure that he's fighting the right person. When the photos arrived earlier, all he can feel is the thirst to have his revenge. Lumapit si Ken at kinwelyuhan si Xander, ""You ruined my plans, alam mo ba?""","Ken hired a detective to look upon the root of the issue. He wanted to make sure that he's fighting the right person. When the photos arrived earlier, all he can feel is the thirst to have his revenge. Ken approached and grabbed Xander's collar, ""You ruined my plans, do you know that?"""
"Xander's eyes darkened along with a sarcastic laugh, ""At alam mo rin bang ikaw ang unang nanira ng plano sa ating dalawa? Sabi ko naman sa'yo, 'di ba? Hindi pa tayo tapos. Now, we're even."" Di alam ni Ken kung saan siya kumukuha ng maraming pasensya pero malapit na itong maubos.","Xander's eyes darkened along with a sarcastic laugh, ""And do you also know that you were the first one to ruin the plan between the two of us? I told you, right? We're not done yet. Now, we're even."" Ken doesn't know where he's getting so much patience but it's about to run out."
"Josh can see fire in the eyes of Ken. He wants to stop him before he can do something that might worsen the situation but when he saw how much Ken is holding back, Josh knew he could trust Ken's decisions. ""Hindi patas ang ginawa mo, Xander. Dinamay mo ang pamilya ko.""","Josh can see fire in the eyes of Ken. He wants to stop him before he can do something that might worsen the situation but when he saw how much Ken is holding back, Josh knew he could trust Ken's decisions. ""What you did was unfair, Xander. You involved my family."""
"Tila mas lalo pang nang-asar si Xander nang bahagya itong tumawa at matamang tumitig sa mga mata ni Ken. ""Ano bang gusto mo? Suntok para maging patas? Sige na, gawin mo na. Oh baka naman masyado kang mahina—"" Napapikit si Xander nang iangat ni Ken ang kamao niya.","Xander seemed to provoke even more when he laughed slightly and stared intently into Ken's eyes. ""What do you want? A punch so it will be fair? Go ahead, do it now. Or maybe you're too weak—"" Xander closed his eyes when Ken raised his fist."
"Isa. Dalawa. Tatlo. Ilang segundo pa ang lumipas ngunit walang naramdamang suntok si Xander. Nang imulat niya ang mga mata ay nakita niyang nasa ere pa rin ang kamao ni Ken habang masama ang titig sa kaniya. ""O-Oh? Bakit hindi mo ituloy?! Duwag ka naman pala eh.""","One. Two. Three. A few more seconds passed but Xander didn't feel a punch. When he opened his eyes, he saw that Ken's fist was still in the air while staring badly at him. ""O-Oh? Why don't you continue?! You're just a coward eh."""
"Ngumisi si Ken at itinulak palayo si Xander, ""Wala pa nga, nauutal ka na eh. Sinong duwag sa atin? Isa pa, masyadong magaan kung susuntukin lang kita."" Kinuha ni Ken ang mga litrato at ipinasok sa envelope bago nagpatuloy. ""I'd rather see you in court than in a hospital.""","Ken smirked and pushed Xander away, ""You haven't even felt anything, you're already stuttering eh. Who's the coward between us? Besides, it's too easy if I just punch you."" Ken took the pictures and put them in the envelope before continuing. ""I'd rather see you in court than in a hospital."""
"Xander raised an eyebrow, trying to hide his nervousness. ""Anong ibig mong sabihin?"" ""Ang ibig kong sabihin, hindi ako patas gumanti. Walang salitang patas lalo na sa mga taong tulad mo. Maling mali ka ng binangga, Xander."" Ken plastered a smile before turning his back.","Xander raised an eyebrow, trying to hide his nervousness. ""What do you mean?"" ""What I mean is, I don't retaliate fairly. There's no such thing as fair especially for people like you. You bumped into the wrong person, Xander."" Ken plastered a smile before turning his back."
"Pero matapos ang dalawang hakbang ay tumigil si Ken at muling lumingon kay Xander. ""Ah oo nga pala, I forgot to ask. Magkano ang nakuha mong pera kay Mr. Lee kapalit ng mga litrato namin?"" Muling nangunot ang noo ni Xander ngunit agad din siyang ngumisi bilang tugon.","But after two steps, Ken stopped and looked back at Xander again. ""Oh yeah, I forgot to ask. How much money did you get from Mr. Lee in exchange for our pictures?"" Xander frowned again but he immediately smirked in response."
"""You guess,"" pang-aasar ni Xander pero umiling lamang si Ken at bahagyang ngumisi. ""Wala akong panahong manghula pero sana naman malaki ang nakuha mo sa kaniya. Mmm, maybe big enough to start your own auditing firm? Or maybe just enough to get you out of this country?""","""You guess,"" Xander teased but Ken just shook his head and smirked slightly. ""I don't have time to guess but I hope you got a lot from him. Mmm, maybe big enough to start your own auditing firm? Or maybe just enough to get you out of this country?"""
"Nang mapansing naguguluhan na si Xander ay nagpakawala ng tawa si Ken. ""Oh, sorry. Nakalimutan kong sabihin. I stumbled upon my investigation that you accepted multiple bribes from your clients? Tsk tsk. Your boss is really upset when he heard this. Not a good a example ah.""","When he noticed that Xander was already confused, Ken let out a laugh. ""Oh, sorry. I forgot to say. I stumbled upon my investigation that you accepted multiple bribes from your clients? Tsk tsk. Your boss is really upset when he heard this. Not a good example ah."""
"Xander's eyes widened. Unable to speak, Ken continued talking. ""Biruin mo nga naman? Kaibigan ko pala ang boss mo? Mmm, he's my senior during high school days. Napagkwentuhan ka nga namin yesterday eh at may pinapasabi siya sa'yo."" Ken plastered a sweet smile to Xander.","Xander's eyes widened. Unable to speak, Ken continued talking. ""Imagine that? It turns out my boss is my friend? Mmm, he's my senior during high school days. We even talked about you yesterday eh and he has something to say to you."" Ken plastered a sweet smile to Xander."
"""Sabi niya, ienjoy mo na lang daw 'yung leave mo. Wag ka na raw babalik kasi hindi ka na nila kailangan sa company. Mmm, ano pa ba? Ah! Your license... What will happen if they file a lawsuit against you? Tsk tsk. Good luck, I guess?"" Ken was enjoying Xander's state of misery.","""He said, just enjoy your leave. Don't come back because they don't need you in the company anymore. Mmm, what else? Ah! Your license... What will happen if they file a lawsuit against you? Tsk tsk. Good luck, I guess?"" Ken was enjoying Xander's state of misery."
"""H-Hayop ka! Ang sama sama mo—"" Ken stared directly at Xander's eyes before cutting his rants, ""You ruined my career first. Hindi ba patas lang na sirain ko rin 'yung sa'yo?"" Nananatiling seryoso si Ken, bakas ang iba't ibang emosyon bago nito binitiwan ang huling linya niya.","""- You're an animal! You're so bad —"" Ken stared directly at Xander's eyes before cutting his rants, ""You ruined my career first. Isn't it just fair that I ruin yours too?"" Ken remained serious, various emotions evident before he uttered his last line."
"""If you happen to survive all the lawsuits, prepare to leave this place immediately. Dahil hangga't nakikita kita sa paligid ko, hinding hindi kita titigilan. Run as far as you can, Xander. Hindi talaga ako patas gumanti."" With that, Ken turned his back and started walking away.","""If you happen to survive all the lawsuits, prepare to leave this place immediately. Because as long as I see you around, I will never stop haunting you. Run as far as you can, Xander. I really don't retaliate fairly."" With that, Ken turned his back and started walking away."

Kailangan maglakad ng malayo para lang makabili ng bigas sa Kadiwa.,You had to walk far just to buy rice at the Kadiwa.

Masakit nga my natutonan nman,"It hurts, but I learned something."
Di ako mapanakit.. Ako lang yong sinasaktan nila,I don't like hurting others. I'm just the one they hurt.
I mean sa relasyon Pag sa ibang sitwasyon my nasaktan din akong damdamin,"I mean, in a relationship. In other situations, I've hurt someone's feelings, too."
Magjojowa pa din ako bahala ka jan hahahaha,"I'm still going to have a boyfriend, whatever you say, hahaha."
Wahahaha raulo Sabi ko saU knina turoan mo muna ako ulit pano pag jowa na karapat dapat..,"Wahahaha, you're such a mess. I told you earlier to teach me again what counts as a worthy partner."
Yan na nga ang problema jan sa sinasabing sakal nkakasakal ba yong wlang time nakakasakal ba yong sasabihin mo lang na ganetong hrs wlang paramdam,"That's the problem, this so-called being suffocated. Is having no time suffocating? Is it suffocating when you just say you'll be available at these hours, and then you disappear?"
Instant pa ako sa instant noodles Pag sa jowa kasi di ko pinaparanas sa knya yong kakausapin lang kita pag gusto ko lang kasi ako khit gano pa ako kabusy paglalaanan tlaga kita ng oras napag aralan ko na nga paano maging matigas minsan ng di taU abusohin,"I'm even faster than instant noodles. Because with a boyfriend, I don't let him experience only being able to talk to me when I want to because, even if I'm busy, I'll really make time for you. I've even learned how to be tough sometimes so I won't be abused."
Alam mo kailangan din kasi natin minsan ang magpakabato para di taU abusohin lalo na pag subra taUng lambot naranasan ko na yan kasi tas minsan sa subrang bait natin madalas inaabuso kaya ayaw ko ng mangyari pa yon ulit,"You know, sometimes we also need to be tough so we won't be abused, especially if we're too soft. I've experienced that because sometimes, because we're so nice, we're often abused, so I don't want that to happen again."
Ako my pagkapusong mamon din nman pero minsan kailangan magmatigas lalo na pag subra subra yong ginagawa pero marunong pa din akong magpakumbaba at magpatawad,"I'm sweet, too, but sometimes I need to be tough, especially if what they're doing is way too much. But I still know how to be humble and forgive."
"Yes di ko kayang magtanim ng galit or sama ng loob Mas lalo ko pang pinagpray yong mga taong nagawan ako ng mali.. Di ba sabi ng Lord kung makapito man nagkasala saU, makapitongpotpito mo din tong patatawarin ganon paniniwala ko kaya di ko kayang mgtanim ng galit","Yes, I can't hold grudges or resentments. I even pray more for the people who have wronged me. Didn't the Lord say that if someone sins against you seven times, you should forgive them seventy times seven? That's my belief, so I can't hold grudges."

ang ganda mo kanina,You looked so beautiful earlier.
akapin nga kita.. cute mo eh... Yung totoo epekto ba ng kapapanood mo? O ako ba dahilan?,"Let me hug you. You're cute. Seriously, is it because of what you're watching? Or am I the reason?"
alam mo wala naman problema sa akin kung maglalambing ka. Mas okay nga yun. Kasi gumagaan pakiramdam ko.,"You know, I don't have a problem with you being affectionate. It's even better that way. Because it makes me feel lighter."
so gf na nga kita? Cute ng gf ko.. naglalambing...,"So, are you my girlfriend now? My girlfriend's cute. Being affectionate..."
iloveyou! Ikaw lang mahal ko okay.. wag selosa ..,"I love you! You're the only one I love, okay? Don't be jealous."
alam ko na di mo maiiwasan mag selos.. natural naman talaga. So ako na mag aadjust sa gf ko.. Di ba? Mahal ko?,"I know you can't avoid being jealous; it's natural. So, I'll adjust for my girlfriend. Right? My love?"
ilan beses ka na ganon.. sa akin lagi mo ko inaaaway eh. Away bati tayo.. Di rin naman kita matiis na di kausapin. Masyado ka rin nagpapacute,"How many times have you done that? You always pick a fight with me. We fight and make up. I can't stand not talking to you either. You're too cute, too."
di ko rin maintindihan kung bakit kakaiba nararamdaman ko sa iyo di ko maexplain Di ko alam kung maiinis ako o matatawa o ano .. ah basta kakaiba..,"I also don't understand why I feel something different for you; I can't explain it. I don't know if I should be annoyed or laugh or what. Ah, it's just different."
di ko ito naramdaman sa iba. Sa iyo lang.. ah siguro masyado lang ako masaya sa iyo.. siguro di ba?,"I haven't felt this with anyone else. Only with you. Ah, maybe I'm just too happy with you. Maybe, right?"
ang importante.. nakikita ko yung totoong ngiti mo. Kahit yun lang makita ko sayo masaya na ko.. Nakakagaan ng loob kasi yung pakiramdam na nginingitian ka ng taong mahalaga sa iyo. Kasi..,"What's important is... I see your genuine smile. Even if that's all I see from you, I'm already happy. It's heartwarming to feel like the person important to you is smiling at you. Because..."
kasi.. makikita mo kahalagahan mo sa kanya. Kaya napaka-importante na ngumigiti ka ng totoo sa mga taong mahahalaga sa buhay mo. At maalala ka man nila. Na yung pagngiti mo magbibigay ng inspirasyon. Pag aalala ng kapanatagan ng loob. Pagkalma..,Because... you'll see your importance to them. That's why it's so important to smile genuinely at the people who are important in your life. And so they remember you. That your smile gives them inspiration. A memory of peace. Calm...
iba pagngiting may ginagawang kalokohan sa pangiti ng pahihiganti.. Iba rin pangiti ng kilig Sa masayang pagngiti. Magkakaiba ang interpretasyon nyan. Nasa sa iyo kung ano meaning ng pangiti mo sa bawat sitwasyon.,It's different when you smile because of mischief versus smiling for revenge. There's also smiling out of giddiness versus a happy smile. There are different interpretations of that. It's up to you what your smile means in each situation.
yun lang din kasi naisip kong paraan kasi ang lungkot talaga ng mga tao noon.. Kahit ano nawawalan na rin ako ng pag asa pero pag naaalala kita at yung mga taong importante sa akin..,"That's the only way I could think because people were so sad back then. I lose hope, too, but when I remember you and the people important to me..."
dun ko kinukuha yan. Yun lang lakas ko para mag-ipagpatuloy pa ang buhay.. wala naman kasi ibang choice.. Iloveyou!,That's where I get it from. That's my only strength to continue living life... there's no other choice. I love you!

The presidency is a job. Perhaps the most difficult job there is in the country. Presidentiables need to be seen as applicants. Aplikante po sila at tayo ang HR ng bansa. Bawat isa sa atin ay may karapatang malaman at magtanong sa kanila na mga nag-aapply.,"The presidency is a job. Perhaps the most difficult job there is in the country. Presidentiables need to be seen as applicants. They are applicants, and we are the HR of the country. Each of us has the right to know and ask those who are applying."
Dito walang OJT (pero meron yung First 100 Days). Mayroon tayong lampas 5 buwan para kilalanin at kilatisin ang bawat isa. Hindi natin kailangan magtalo. Kailangan nating matutong mamili. Sila ang kailangan magpakita / magpamalas bakit sila ang susunod na pangulo natin.,There's no OJT here (but there's the First 100 Days). We have more than 5 months to know and scrutinize each one. We don't need to argue. We need to learn how to choose. They need to show/demonstrate why they should be our next president.
"BIO-DATA o CURRICULUM VITAE Tulad ng mga aplikante, kailangan sanang masusi nating pag-aralan ang kakayanan ng bawat presidentiable. Ano ang natapos nila? Ano na naging trabaho nila? Ano na nagawa nila bilang isang serbisyo publiko?","BIO-DATA or CURRICULUM VITAE Like applicants, we should carefully study the ability of each presidentiable. What did they finish? What jobs have they had? What have they done as a public service?"
Di ba nga marami sa mga job hiring ay pagandahan pa ng kanilang CV. Asahan nating ganun din dito sa mga naghahangad na maging presidente (at iba pang posisyon) Trabaho nating kilatisin ito. Sino ang maayos/matino? Sino nagpapanggap? Dito masisilayan ang kanilang kakayanan.,Don't many job hirings even beautify their CV? We should expect the same from those who aspire to be president (and other positions). It's our job to scrutinize this. Who is decent/sane? Who is pretending? This is where their ability can be seen.
PHYSICAL EXAM & DRUG TESTING Maraming aplikante ang nahihingan ng medical report na may kasamang lab tests — blood tests/urinalysis — at chest xray. Damay na rin natin ang drug testing. Ganun dapat tayo mangilatis ng presidentiables. Need natin matino at matikas. PILIpinas2022,PHYSICAL EXAM & DRUG TESTING Many applicants are asked for a medical report with lab tests included — blood tests/urinalysis — and a chest x-ray. Let's also include drug testing. That's how we should scrutinize presidentiables. We need someone sane and strong. PHVote2022
"CHARACTER REFERENCE Atin din dinidinig ang nasasabi ng mga nakasama sa trabaho, mga nakasalamuha o nagturo sa mga aplikante. Dito natin nakikita ang kanilang pagtrato sa tao, ugali sa trabaho, kakayanan na tukuyin ang mga hamon nito. Ito ay mga bagay na dapat alamin natin.","CHARACTER REFERENCE We also listen to what their co-workers, those they interacted with, or those who taught the applicants have to say. Here, we see how they treat people, their work ethic, and their ability to identify its challenges. These are things we should find out."

Shouldn't public health professionals be angrier at the government, corporations, and policymakers who allowed the malls to open while the vaccination rate isn't that high but the Covid deaths are high?"
"Masmadali na lang talaga lagi bang sabihin 'Bahala kayo sobrang mahal po magpaospital ngayon grrrr kasalanan ninyo bakit may surge!!!!' kesa sabihin na 'Grabe talaga ang for-profit healthcare system, parang ang pasyente kong walang pera wala nang karapatang magpagamot!'????","Is it just easier to always say, 'It's up to you.

Have all ages and demographics in all corners of the country been given vaccines?"
'Di ba imbis na national effort that should be coming from the head of state (aka yung tuta sa Malacañang) bahala na lang kung magaling ang LGU mo o hindi? O kung maabot ka ng efforts ng OVP ni Leni?

At ang contact tracing 'di naman talaga matino, tila nagagamit pa sa data breach ang info ng mga tao?","Even if we point out that there is vaccine hesitancy in some populations, the main issue is still the lack of vaccine supply and the slowness of the rollout, right?

Saan lulugar?","Because they are ~pressured~ and want their businesses to earn while still enjoying kickbacks from the funds that should be used to solve the pandemic. Then it’s hard, you stay at home, you gain nothing. You go out of the house, there's still a risk of getting sick. Where do you belong?"

"TL;DR: Sana i-spend na lang yung energy na igiit sa estadong panagutan ang kasalanan nito ngayong pandemya, kasi halos wala itong nagawang tama. Sayang energy manigaw ng 'KAYO DAHILAN NG SURGE PESTE KAYO!' sa mga nasa mall isa-isa. Akala ko rin dati productive 'yon, 'di pala.","TL;DR: I hope we just spend the energy to insist that the state take responsibility for its mistakes during this pandemic because it has hardly done anything right. It's a waste of energy to shout 'YOU ARE THE REASON FOR THE SURGE, YOU PESTS!' to the people in the mall one by one. I used to think that was productive, but it wasn't."

Nanatili naman sila Baekhyun at Sehun sa bahay nila Chanyeol para masamahan ni Baekhyun si Kyungsoo. Kasalukuyan namang nasa sala yung dalawa habang sila Chanyeol at Sehun ay nasa kusina. Naghahanda ng snacks si Chanyeol para sa kanila at tinutulungan naman siya ni Sehun.,Baekhyun and Sehun stayed at Chanyeol's house so that Baekhyun could be with Kyungsoo. The two were currently in the living room while Chanyeol and Sehun were in the kitchen. Chanyeol was preparing snacks for them and Sehun was helping him.
"“Sin.” Tawag ni Sehun. Saglit namang napatingin si Chanyeol sa kanya at ibinaling naman niya ulit ang tingin niya sa ginagawa niya. “Bakit?” ""I just want to say sorry sa ginawa ni Kuya Alon kay Mage. Di man kami sobrang close ni kuya I still want to say sorry on his behalf.”","“Sin.” Sehun called. Chanyeol glanced at him for a moment and then turned his gaze back to what he was doing. “Why?” ""I just want to say sorry for what Kuya Alon did to Mage. We're not super close to Kuya, but I still want to say sorry on his behalf.”"
"Chanyeol pursed his lips as he lightly nodded his head. ""I appreciate that. And don't worry about it mas galit ako sa sarili ko kesa kay Kuya Alon."" Napatigil naman si Sehun sa ginagawa niya at napalingon siya kay Chanyeol. ""Dahil ba hinayaan mong mangyare ang mga nangyare?""","Chanyeol pursed his lips as he lightly nodded his head. ""I appreciate that. And don't worry about it. I'm angrier at myself than at Kuya Alon."" Sehun stopped what he was doing and turned to Chanyeol. ""Because you let what happened happen?"""
"Tumango naman si Chanyeol. ""Simula palang iba na pakiramdam ko kay Kuya Alon ehh pero hinayaan ko kasi gustong-gusto siya ni Mage. Kung san masaya si Mage dun ako."" Napatitig naman saglit si Sehun sa kanya at bahagya siyang napabuntong hininga.","Chanyeol nodded. ""From the beginning, I had a different feeling about Kuya Alon, but I let it go because Mage really liked him. Wherever Mage is happy, that's where I am."" Sehun stared at him for a moment and sighed slightly."
"Ibinaling naman ulit ni Sehun tingin niya sa ginagawa niya at dito na siya nagsalita. ""Sin, may gusto ka kay Mage diba?"" Natigilan naman si Chanyeol sa biglang tanong ni Sehun. ""I mean, mahal mo siya diba?"" Hindi naman makasagot si Chanyeol at napatingin lang siya sa kawalan.","Sehun turned his gaze back to what he was doing, and that's when he spoke. ""Sin, you like Mage, right?” Chanyeol stopped at Sehun's sudden question. ""I mean, you love her, right?” Chanyeol couldn't answer and just stared into space."
"Nilingon naman ni Sehun si Chanyeol at bahagya namang napangisi si Chanyeol. With Chanyeol's reaction, Sehun already knows the answer. Napabuntong hininga naman si Sehun sabay tango. ""I see. Mahal mo nga. I can tell matagal mo na siyang mahal tama ba?""","Sehun turned to Chanyeol, and Chanyeol smiled slightly. With Chanyeol's reaction, Sehun already knows the answer. Sehun sighed and nodded. ""I see. You really love her. I can tell you've loved her for a long time, right?"""
"Napabuntong hininga naman si Chanyeol at nagpatuloy naman siya sa pagtimpla ng maiinom nila. ""Ever since. But it doesn't matter. I'm already contented just being close to him. That's enough for me. And besides, mahal niya si Kuya Alon. Kita ko kung gaano niya siya kamahal.""","Chanyeol sighed and continued preparing their drinks. ""Ever since. But it doesn't matter. I'm already content just being close to him. That's enough for me. And besides, he loves Kuya Alon. I can see how much he loves him."""
"""So, you won't try and confess to him?"" ""It's better to keep what I feel. Ayoko maguluhan si Mage. If I tell him what I feel mappressure yun. He’d feel bad kasi he can’t return the feelings. Baka masira lang din pagkakaibigan namin dahil dun.”","""So, you won't try and confess to him?"" ""It's better to keep what I feel. I don't want to confuse Mage. If I tell him how I feel, he'll feel pressured. He’d feel bad because he can’t return the feelings. Our friendship might just be ruined because of it."""
“Kaya ka ba may girlfriend?” “Huh?” “Kaya ka ba may girlfriend para maisantabi feelings mo para sa kanya?” Napahinga naman ng malalim si Chanyeol at naglakad naman siya papunta sa ref para kumuha ng yelo. “Nung una pero ngayon gusto ko narin naman si Riki.”,"""Is that why you have a girlfriend?"" ""Huh?"" ""Is that why you have a girlfriend, to suppress your feelings for him?"" Chanyeol took a deep breath and walked to the refrigerator to get some ice. ""At first, yes, but now I also like Riki."""
“Pero si Mage parin top one sa puso mo?” Hindi naman sumagot si Chanyeol at inabala niya sarili niya sa tinitimpla niyang inumin. “Enough about us. Kayo ba ni Resi? Mutual naman feelings niyo at matagal niyo na kilala isa’t isa bat nasa ligawan stage kayo?”,"""But is Mage still number one in your heart?"" Chanyeol didn't answer and busied himself with preparing the drink. ""Enough about us. What about you and Resi? You both have mutual feelings and you've known each other for a long time, so why are you still in the courtship stage?"""
"“‘Cause I still want to do it right. Slowly but surely. Atsaka matagal din yung mga taon na hindi kami nagkausap at nagkita. Madaming nagbago at nadagdag sa mga buhay namin kaya we still need to have this getting to know stage, this ligawan stage.”","""Because I still want to do it right. Slowly but surely. Besides, it's been a long time since we last talked and saw each other. A lot has changed and been added to our lives, so we still need to have this getting-to-know stage, this courtship stage."""
"“Hmm… sabagay. Pero teka matanong nga kita, nung una sabi mo raw kay Resi friends lang, bakit?” Bahagya namang umismid ng tawa si Sehun at medyo nakaramdam siya ng onting hiya rito. “Nakakahiya man amin pero natakot kasi ako.” “Natakot? Saan?”","""Hmm… I guess. But wait, let me ask you something. At first, you said you and Resi were just friends, why?"" Sehun chuckled slightly and felt a bit embarrassed. ""It's embarrassing to admit, but I was scared."" ""Scared? Of what?"""
“Natakot ako na baka umulit ulit yung sakit na naranasan ko sa nakaraan namin. Sa totoo lang yung biglang paglaho ni Resi sobrang naapektuhan ako nun. Mahal ko siya ehh tas bigla na lang siyang naglaho ng parang bula. I don’t even know what happened kaya di ko alam iisipin ko.”,"""I was scared that I'd experience the same pain I felt in our past again. Honestly, Resi's sudden disappearance really affected me. I love him, and then he just vanished like a bubble. I don’t even know what happened, so I don't know what to think."""
Napatango naman si Chanyeol sabay hingang malalim. “Sabagay. Kung ako rin nasa posisyon mo matatakot nga rin ako. Buti nagrisk ka ulit. Na-trigger ka ba nung supervisor ni Resi?” Di naman napigilan ni Sehun tawa niya pero tumango naman siya in response sa tanong ni Chanyeol.,"Chanyeol nodded and took a deep breath. ""I guess so. If I were in your position, I’d be scared too. Good thing you took the risk again. Were you triggered by Resi's supervisor?"" Sehun couldn't help but laugh but nodded in response to Chanyeol's question."
"“That actually really made me feel more scared but this time it’s scared about totally losing Resi. I mean, I’d rather be hurt again with the same pain from the past rather than being hurt from a new pain which is losing Resi to another person. Kaya I’m risking it.”","""That actually really made me feel more scared, but this time it’s scared about totally losing Resi. I mean, I’d rather be hurt again with the same pain from the past rather than being hurt from a new pain which is losing Resi to another person. That's why I’m risking it."""
“Sir Clark became your wake up call huh?” “Yeah. I guess. Sana ikaw din magkaron ka ng taong gigising sayo.” “Tss. Gago. Ayos na nga ako sa sitwasyon namin ngayon.” “You’re saying that now kasi di pa secured talaga si Mage pero tignan mo talaga pag yan si Kuya Alon naging,"""Sir Clark became your wake-up call, huh?"" ""Yeah. I guess. I hope you also have someone who will wake you up."" ""Tss. Idiot. I'm fine with our situation now."" ""You’re saying that now because Mage isn’t really secured yet, but just you wait until Kuya Alon becomes really stable and serious with Mage."""
totoong maayos na at seseryosohin na niya talaga si Mage. You’ll feel what I felt talaga.” “Tigilan mo na nga ako dyan. Tara na. Tapos na ko dito. Tapos ka na ba dyan sa dip ng nachos?” Tumango naman si Sehun at binuhat naman na niya yung bowl ng dip at yung bowl ng nachos.,"You’ll really feel what I felt."" ""Stop it already. Let's go. I'm done here. Are you done with the nachos dip?"" Sehun nodded and picked up the bowl of dip and the bowl of nachos."
Sabay naman na silang lumabas ng kusina at diretsong pumunta sa sala kung saan nag-uusap yung dalawang magkaibigan. Pagkarating nila doon ay di naman na umiiyak si Kyungsoo at nagchichismisan na yung dalawa. “Bilis naman makarecover sa iyak ni Mage.” Natatawang bulong ni Sehun.,"They both went out of the kitchen and went straight to the living room where the two friends were talking. When they got there, Kyungsoo was no longer crying, and the two were already gossiping. ""Mage recovered from crying so quickly."" Sehun whispered, laughing."
“Ganyan yan. Pero panigurado mamaya pag mag-isa na lang ulit yan iiyak na naman yan.” “Edi wag mo iwan mag-isa. Samahan mo matulog sa kwarto niya.” “Luh sira ka ba? Never pa nga akong nakapasok sa kwarto niyan.” “Luh talaga ba?”,"""That's just how he is. But for sure, later when he's alone again, he'll cry again."" ""Then don't leave him alone. Stay with him in his room."" ""Are you crazy? I've never even been inside his room."" ""Really?"""
“Oo. I have full respect for him kaya I never enter his room. Mas nauna pa ngang makapasok dun si Kuya Alon kesa sa ‘kin ehh.” “Wow. Sa tagal niyong magkaibigan never ka pa talagang nakapasok dun?” “Oo nga. Siya madalas pumapasok sa kwarto ko kahit walang paalam.”,"""Yes. I have full respect for him, so I never enter his room. Kuya Alon even got to enter it before me."" ""Wow. After being friends for so long, you've never really been inside there?"" ""Yeah. He often enters my room without permission."""
"“Kahit papasukin ka niya sa kwarto niya di ka pumapasok?” “Oo. I make excuses. Anyway, tara na.” Nauna naman nang lumapit si Chanyeol kela Kyungsoo at Baekhyun at nilapag naman niya yung tray na may pitchel ng juice at mga baso sa lamesa.","""Even if he lets you into his room, you don't go in?"" ""Yes. I make excuses. Anyway, let's go."" Chanyeol went to Kyungsoo and Baekhyun first and placed the tray with the pitcher of juice and glasses on the table."
Kinuha naman niya yung isang mug na andun na may lamang hot choco at ibinigay niya kay Kyungsoo. “Eto sayo. Swiss Miss with coffee and cream to make you calmer.” Napatingin naman si Kyungsoo kay Chanyeol at bahagya namang lumambot ang mga titig niya habang bahagyang napanguso.,"He took one of the mugs that already had hot chocolate and gave it to Kyungsoo. ""Here you go. Swiss Miss with coffee and cream to make you calmer."" Kyungsoo looked at Chanyeol and his gaze softened slightly as he pouted slightly."
"“Thank you, bes. You really know me.” Ngumiti lang naman si Chanyeol sa kanya at naupo siya sa tabi nito. Napapangisi naman si Sehun haban inilapag yung chips sa lamesa. Napansin naman ni Baekhyun yung ngisi nito kaya naman napatitig siya kay Sehun na medyo nakakunot ang noo.","""Thank you, best friend. You really know me."" Chanyeol just smiled at him and sat beside him. Sehun grinned as he put the chips on the table. Baekhyun noticed his grin, so he stared at Sehun with a slightly furrowed brow."
Naglakad naman papunta si Sehun kay Baekhyun at naupo siya sa tabi nito. “Bat ka ngumingisi dyan ha?” Agad na tanong ni Baekhyun kay Sehun. “Ha? Ahh wala naman.” “Wala daw.” Natawa naman ng kaonti si Sehun at piningot niya ang ilong ni Baekhyun na ikinabigla nung isa.,"Sehun walked over to Baekhyun and sat beside him. ""Why are you grinning?"" Baekhyun immediately asked Sehun. ""Huh? Oh, nothing."" ""He says nothing."" Sehun laughed a little and pinched Baekhyun's nose, which surprised him."
"“Kulit talaga. Wala nga. Anyway, musta si Mage? Napahingang malalim naman si Baekhyun at kumuha naman siya ng chips doon sa bowl bago magsalita. “Medyo kalmado na siya. Sabi niya maayos naman pag-uusap nila ni Kuya Alon ehh. He just really chose to break up with him to give","""You're really annoying. It's nothing. Anyway, how's Mage?"" Baekhyun sighed deeply and took some chips from the bowl before speaking. ""He's a little calmer now. He said that his talk with Kuya Alon went well. He just really chose to break up with him to give"
Kuya Alon time to heal and move forward on his own. Sinabi naman niya sa kanya na if he’s already fully healed and have moved forward he’ll give him another chance.” “Really? Wow. Mahal na mahal niya nga talaga si Kuya Alon.” “Sobra. I get him naman. Iba talaga pag first love.”,"Kuya Alon time to heal and move forward on his own. He told him that if he’s already fully healed and has moved forward, he’ll give him another chance."" ""Really? Wow. He really loves Kuya Alon so much."" ""So much. I get him, though. First love is really something else."""
"Napatitig naman si Sehun kay Baekhyun at bahagya naman siyang napangisi. “Hmm… speaking of first love, sino first love mo, kupz? Ako ba?” Para namang nabilaukan si Baekhyun sa kinakain niyang chips kaya naman dali-daling kumuha ng juice si Sehun at binigay ito kay Baekhyun.","Sehun stared at Baekhyun and grinned slightly. ""Hmm… speaking of first love, who's your first love? Is it me?"" Baekhyun seemed to choke on the chips he was eating, so Sehun quickly grabbed some juice and gave it to Baekhyun."
"“Luh. Babes, ayos ka lang? Anyare sayo dyan?” Alalang tanong ni Kyungsoo. Tumango naman si Baekhyun at ipinokus niya ang sarili sa pag-inom nung juice. Marahan namang hinimas ni Sehun sa likod si Baekhyun at pilit naman niyang pinipigilan ang mapangiti ng husto.","""Luh. Babes, are you okay? What happened to you?"" Kyungsoo asked worriedly. Baekhyun nodded and focused on drinking the juice. Sehun gently rubbed Baekhyun's back and tried to stop himself from smiling too much."

~ Bago magtanghalian naman pumunta si Sehun sa bahay nila Baekhyun. Sinabihan kasi siya ng nanay ni Baekhyun na doon na lang sila mananghalian. Pagkarating naman ni Sehun doon ay naliligo pa si Baekhyun kaya naman tinulungan niya munang magluto ang nanay ni Baekhyun.,"Before lunch, Sehun went to Baekhyun's house. Baekhyun's mother told him to have lunch there. When Sehun arrived, Baekhyun was still taking a bath, so he helped Baekhyun's mother cook first."
"""Musta naman panliligaw mo kay Resi, anak?"" Tanong ng nanay ni Baekhyun. ""Ayos naman po, tita. Di naman po ako masyadong pinapahirapan ni Resi. Pero tita ang tigas ng ulo talaga ng anak niyo po. Pag may overtime sila laging nagpapalipas ng hapunan.""","""How's your courtship with Resi going, son?"" Baekhyun's mother asked. ""It's going well, Tita. Resi isn't giving me too much of a hard time. But Tita, your son is really stubborn. When they have overtime, he always skips dinner."""
"""Ay nako, anak. Yan din sinesermon ko kay Resi. Sinabing kumain siya sa tamang oras tuwing nag-oovertime sila kasi nga mahina katawan niya."" ""Kaya nga po tita ehh. Pero tita di uubra yun sa 'kin kaya ginagawa ko tita pinupuntahan ko siya sa opisina nila para dalan ng pagkain.""","""Oh dear, son. I also lecture Resi about that. I told him to eat at the right time whenever they have overtime because he's weak."" ""That's right, Tita. But Tita, that won't work on me, so what I do is I go to his office to bring him food."""
"Bahagya namang natawa ang nanay ni Baekhyun at napatango pa ito ng ulo. ""Tama yan. Dapat talaga sapilitan para sumunod yan."" Napatingin naman ang nanay ni Baekhyun kay Sehun at napangiti naman ito ng malambot dito. ""Anak, maraming salamat ha? Salamat at inaalagaan mo anak ko.""","Baekhyun's mother laughed slightly and nodded her head. ""That's right. You really have to force him to follow."" Baekhyun's mother looked at Sehun and smiled softly at him. ""Son, thank you so much, okay? Thank you for taking care of my son."""
"Napabaling naman ang tingin ni Sehun dito at hiya naman siyang napangiti. ""Responsibilidad ko po yun, tita. Kaakibat po ng pagmamahal ko sa kanya ang pag-alaga sa kanya."" ""Tama talaga pakiramdam ko sayo nung una kitang nakita sa palengke. Sabi na mabuti kang bata.""","Sehun looked at her and smiled shyly. ""It's my responsibility, Tita. Taking care of him goes hand in hand with my love for him."" ""I really had a feeling about you when I first saw you at the market. I knew you were a good kid."""
"Ngumiti na lang naman si Sehun at nagpatuloy na sila sa niluluto nila. Maya-maya naman ay biglang sumigaw si Baekhyun mula sa taas dahil sa 2nd floor bathroom siya naligo. ""Inay!!! Asan po yung mga shampoo?! Wala na pong shampoo dito!"" ""Ayy anak! Andito sa baba! Nasa banyo!""","Sehun just smiled and they continued cooking. After a while, Baekhyun suddenly shouted from upstairs because he took a bath in the 2nd-floor bathroom. ""Mom!!! Where are the shampoos?! There's no shampoo here!"" ""Oh, son! It's down here! In the bathroom!"""
"""Paakyatan po ako, nay!"" Kikilos na sana ang nanay ni Baekhyun para kuhanan ng shampoo ang anak pero pinigilan naman ito ni Sehun. ""Tita ako na po. Pagpatuloy niyo na lang po pagluluto niyo dyan."" ""Ahh osige, anak. Andun lang sa bungad na lagayan yung mga shampoo.""","""Bring it up here, Mom!"" Baekhyun's mother was about to get shampoo for her son, but Sehun stopped her. ""Tita, I'll do it. Just continue cooking there."" ""Ahh, okay, son. The shampoos are just at the front of the container."""
"""Sige po. Kuhanan ko na po si Resi."" Dali-dali namang tumakbo si Sehun papunta sa banyo at agad naman niyang nakita yung mga shampoo. Kinuha niya yung isang malaki at mabilis na siyang tumakbo papunta sa taas.","""Alright. I'll get it for Resi."" Sehun quickly ran to the bathroom and immediately saw the shampoos. He grabbed a big one and quickly ran upstairs."
Pagkarating naman niya doon ay di naman niya inaasahan na maaabutan niya sa may hallway si Baekhyun na nakatapis at basang-basa ang buhok. Napatitig naman siya rito mula ulo pababa sa paa at bahagya naman siyang napalunok.,"When he got there, he didn't expect to find Baekhyun in the hallway wrapped in a towel and his hair soaking wet. He stared at him from head to toe and swallowed slightly."
"Alam naman niyang maputi si Baekhyun pero di niya inaasahan na ganito itp kaputi at kakinis ang balat. Bahagya naman siyang nagulat nung biglang napalingon sa gawi niya si Baekhyun. ""Ay chanak ka! Bakit andito ka na?!""","He knew Baekhyun was fair-skinned, but he didn't expect his skin to be this fair and smooth. He was slightly surprised when Baekhyun suddenly turned his head in his direction. ""Oh my gosh! Why are you here already?!"""
Gulat na sigaw ni Baekhyun at napatakip naman siya sa katawan niya gamit ang mga kamay niya. Mabilis namang napatalikod si Sehun at ramdam naman niya yung bilis ng kabog ng dibdib niya. Di niya sinasadya pero nakita niya yung mga pandesal ni Baekhyun sa harap.,"Baekhyun shouted in surprise and covered his body with his hands. Sehun quickly turned his back and felt his heart pounding fast. He didn't mean to, but he saw Baekhyun's buns in front."
"Kung titignan mo si Baekhyun mukha siyang patpatin pero pagnakita mo na yung katawan nito ay may tinatago rin talagang mga muscles ito. ""Soㅡsorry, Resi. Nagluluto kasi si tita kaya ako na kumuha nung shampoo."" ""Asan na yung shampoo?!"" ""Eㅡeto.""","If you look at Baekhyun, he looks thin, but if you see his body, he's really hiding some muscles. ""Sㅡsorry, Resi. Tita is cooking, so I got the shampoo instead."" ""Where's the shampoo?!"" ""Hㅡhere."""
"Lilingon na dapat si Sehun para i-abot yung shampoo pero bigla namang sumigaw si Baekhyun. ""Wag ka lilingon! I-abot mo lang yung shampoo! Ako lalapit para kunin! Paglumingon ka itutulak kita talaga dyan!"" Mabilis namang tumango si Sehun at inabot niya sa likod yung shampoo.","Sehun was about to turn around to hand over the shampoo, but Baekhyun suddenly shouted. ""Don't turn around! Just hand over the shampoo! I'll come closer to get it! If you turn around, I'll really push you there!"" Sehun quickly nodded and handed the shampoo behind him."
Dahan-dahan namang lumapit si Baekhyun sa kanya at mabilis naman nitong kinuha yung shampoo atsaka humaripas ng takbo pabalik sa loob ng banyo. Pagkapasok niya sa banyo ay nagpakawala siya ng sobrang lalim na buntong hininga at dito naman lalo niyang naramdaman ang hiya.,"Baekhyun slowly approached him and quickly took the shampoo and then ran back into the bathroom. After entering the bathroom, he let out a very deep sigh and it was here that he felt even more embarrassed."

Dapat di na pumayag si bang shiyeok na papuntahin to perform. He should know better. Eversince si Grammys ay trash.,Bang Si-hyuk shouldn't have agreed to let them perform. He should know better. The Grammys have always been trash.

Pera pera labanan kay grammys. Epal yang platform na yan. Dapat dyan cancelgrammys eh.,Everything's about money with the Grammys. That platform is annoying. We should cancel the Grammys.
Oh well… Yung ibang nominated lalo na sa Record of the Year and Song of the Year nga di ko gets bakit kasali eh wala naman masyado ganap.,"Oh well… Some of the nominees, especially for Record of the Year and Song of the Year, I don’t even get why they’re included. They’re not even that popular."
True. Di nga naten sila knows. Di nga sila maingay. San kaya nagbebase si Grammys?,True. We don't even know them. They're not even popular. Where does the Grammys base their decisions?
Hahaha ewan ko ba dyan sa mga yan.,"Hahaha, I don't know about those people."
Dapat iboycott yan ng boys. Pra madala sila.,The boys should boycott them so they learn their lesson.
Remember even BSB na lagi record breaker and sold out concerts before di naman nanalo kahit isa sa dami ng nimonations nila. Something is fishy talaga with Grammys.,Remember even BSB who were always record breakers and had sold out concerts before never won even once despite the number of nominations they had. Something is fishy with the Grammys.
Isa pa yan. Issue ko na yan dati. Akala ko lang iba tlaga ang reviews at policies ni grammys baka ndi pasok bsb naten sa mga categories. Pero sold out concerts til now. Something is not right lalo na ung millennium album nila na tumabo tlaga sa sales pero ndi manalo sa kanila.,"That's another thing. That was already my issue before. I just thought the Grammys had different reviews and policies, that maybe BSB didn't fit into the categories. But they still have sold-out concerts until now. Something is not right, especially Millennium album which really topped the sales but did not win in their awards."
"Di ba? So kung ano nararamdaman ng armys, we felt it even before nung BSB days.","Right? So, what Armys are feeling now, we felt it even before during the BSB days."
alam niyo minsan natatakot na aq sa health q ilang years na ako nagpupuyat last time na natulog ako ng maaga for straight 2 weeks ata which is 9-11 pm is nung dye era pa and there are days na naagahan ako sa tulog pero mas marami padin talaga yung puyat ko,"You know, sometimes I'm scared about my health; it's been years since I've been staying up late. The last time I slept early for straight 2 weeks, around 9-11 pm, was during the 'dye' era, and there are days when I sleep early, but I still stay up late more often."
also pag may bagyo maaga ako nakakatulog,"Also, I sleep early when there's a typhoon."
"di ako maangas,, sadyang naangasan kalang talaga saken.",I'm not arrogant; you're just intimidated by me.

It’s how he deliver his words not so Presidential.,It’s how he delivers his words. It's not Presidential.
Halos naman ng bansa ngayon hard sell or direct coercion ang vaccination. Sa palagay ko hindi maibebenta sa mga ayaw.,Almost every country now uses hard selling or direct coercion for vaccination. I don't think you can sell that to people who are unwilling.
"Mert 750,000 na ang namamatay na Kano kahit hindi maibenta iyan ang gagawin ay itatapon na lang katulad ng mga gamot na hindi nagagamit dito. Hindi ni-re-recycle kahit pwede pang gamitin. Kung mag tapon ako ng gamot sa Police station at pharmacy ay kahon-kahon. Bawal ang re cycle","Mert, 750,000 Americans are dying. Even if you can't sell it, what they'll do is just throw it away like unused medicine. They don't recycle it even if it can be used. If I throw out medicine, I'll bring boxes and boxes to the police station and pharmacy. Recycling is not allowed."
"Madaling mag expire at ma bulok ang mga vaccine ninyo diyan sa USA, may special temperature ang pinag iimbakan ng mga ito. Itatapon talaga. Mura lang naman talaga iyang mga MRNA vaccines na gamit ninyo diyan dahil synthetic.",The vaccines in the USA expire and rot easily. They have a special temperature where you store them. They're just really cheap mRNA vaccines you use there because they are synthetic.
Kaya nga ang vaccine namin talagang naka schedule lalo na kung may insurance ka kasi doon ang reimbursement. Kukulitin ka kahit dental insurance.,"That's why our vaccines are really scheduled, especially if you have insurance, because that's where the reimbursement comes from. They'll keep pestering you, even if it's just dental insurance."
"Dito rin naman sa Metro Manila ay naka schedule rin kaya nga lang ay marami pa rin ang ayaw pagpa bakuna. Iba iba ang dahilan, isa na ang SIKSIKAN sa bakunahan at malamang ay duon pa mahawa ng sakit. Tulad rin diyan ay hindi rin alam ng marami kung ano ang bakuna.","Here in Metro Manila, they're also scheduled. But still, many don't want to get vaccinated. The reasons are different; one is the CROWDING at the vaccination sites, and you'll likely contract diseases there. Like there, many also don't know what the vaccines are."

Beautiful shape too. She needs to grow up already. She's old already, you know. Being 'pasweet' (acting cute) doesn't suit her anymore. Besides, the shots are good. You'll get used to it."
"Alam ko nga matagal na syang kinukuha nyan, siguro ngayon nga lang sya pumayag dahil confident at di na mahigpit yng mgt nya. Syempre may image din naman dati na LL. Atsaka di ba problem nya din dati built nya.","I know they've been getting her for a long time, maybe she only agreed now because she's confident and her manager is no longer strict. Of course, she had an 'LL' [wholesome/innocent] image before. And wasn't her build [form] also her problem before?"
Saka may limitations siguro sa contract niya dati. I'm sure mas may control siya sa contract niya ngayon.,And there were probably limitations in her contract before. I'm sure she has more control over her contract now.

Naturally, they'll give a face shield and face mask; the issue for the 'ate' (older sister) is what BBM did during the pandemic. So there, he gave away what the frontliners needed because they were short at that time. That was Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao."
"Hindi lng isang hospital s'ya namigay, O ano pa ipupuna n'yo sa mga gingawa ni bbm? Jan kayo magaling e,maganda O hindi ginagawa ni bbm may negative comments kayo e, daig n'yo pa si marites","She didn't just donate to one hospital. What else are you going to criticize about what BBM is doing? You're good at that, whether BBM's actions are good or not, you always have negative comments. You're even worse than gossipy neighbors."
Tanginang achievement yan namigay ng faceshield wahahaha,"What a stupid achievement, giving out face shields. Wahahaha."

We know we're right. invidious.tiekoetter.com/lJtkamUZwvo"
"Oh, typo lang yan, baka issue nanaman sainyo yan, (kung ayaw n'yo) kase dapat yan,.pero kung gusto n'yo ulit gnawing issue yan, OK lang yan kayo e, maissue","Oh, that's just a typo, you'll probably make an issue out of that again.

"Yung akin, kahit gusto kong basahin parang nanghihinayang ako kasi naka-sealed. Ayaw kong buksan saka nabasa ko naman na sa wattpad pero gusto ko pa rin basahin na ayaw ko dahil naka-sealed.","As for mine, even though I want to read it, I feel bad because it's still sealed. I don't want to open it. I've already read it on Wattpad, but I still want to read it, but I don't want to because it's sealed."
"Other hms said before that Anji is not responsible for Kd pero bakit parang you obliged her now for his feelings.

"kahit maging jeje typings pa kayo basta capital letter lang yun, aus.","Even if you use 'jeje' typing, as long as those words are capitalized, it's fine."
"maybe, hindi nyo ako maintindihan.",Maybe you don't understand me.
"sa Bible po kasi sa tuwing mababanggit ang word na God, Jesus, Lord is capital letter","In the Bible, every time the words God, Jesus, or Lord are mentioned, they are capitalized."
tapos yung iba small letter na.,Then others use small letters.
as in parang hina-highlights talaga don mismo na dapat capital lagi pag si God,It's like it's really highlighted there that it should always be capitalized when referring to God.
"pero kayo, ang mahalaga nagshare aq at hahayaan ko na si God ang makakita non","But for you, what's important is that I shared it, and I'll just let God see it."
rerespetuhin ko parin kung ano gusto nyo : ),I will still respect whatever you want. :)
"again, ang mahalaga nasabi q na.","Again, what's important is that I've said it."

"Remember when TJ wanted na pagtablahin sina KD at Anji, until now feeling ko yun pa rin talaga plan niya. Nakakagalit yung mga actions ni TJ. After what he has been done, magpapanggap siya na parang walang nangyari at walang nasaktan. Napakagaling maghugas ng kamay. KyJiTalks2","Remember when TJ wanted to pair KD and Anji together? Until now, I feel like that's still his plan. TJ's actions are infuriating. After what he has done, he will pretend like nothing happened and no one was hurt. He's so good at washing his hands.

Talagang pineperahan lng tau nang PBB. Just a suggestion po what if we all stop voting sa next nomination since parang wala naman kwenta ung opinions natin sa PBB. Like come on hindi na nga na address ung issue nang proper tapos ngaun KYJI na naman ung ginagawan nang issue ni TJ.,"PBB is really just milking us for money. Just a suggestion if we all stop voting on the next nomination since it seems like our opinions don't matter to PBB. Like come on, they didn't even address the issue properly, and now TJ is creating an issue regarding KYJI again."
